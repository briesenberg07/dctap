As an introduction to the Dublin Core community, we held an open meeting on Zoom on December 17, 2020. The meeting was recorded and is available on Youtube.

Available here are the slides of the [opening presentation](dctapDecember2020.pdf) by Karen Coyle, and the presentation by Tom Baker of software being developed that processes and creates validation code that implements the constraints in the profile. A [video of the meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDsJU5P5xQY) is available on DCMI's Youtube channel.
